# python '/' and '//'
if we want to divide exactly(no fraction part in result), we must use '//'
python2 and python3 have different performance on '/' when a integer divide a integer
in py2, a integer '/' a integer will just divide exactly
in py3, a integer '/' a integer may get a float number

# use dummy
dummy is a object used as a tool as start of sth like lists
we do not really return it but just return dummy.next
use dummy can reduce unnecessary init code and we can start loop in the begin of need-solving lists
